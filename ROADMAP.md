# Plan: `tetrio-replay-report` — a repo that turns a batch of .ttrm replays into a proof-backed Cantonese report

Decisions locked: **public repo**, **everything included** (replays + reports + full pipeline), goal = **repeatable: drop in a batch of replays → get a report**.

## 0. What the repo is

Not an archive with two reports in it. A **tool** (`pipeline/`) plus **data** (`sessions/`), where adding a session is one command plus an optional prose pass.

## 1. Reuse audit (measured, not assumed)

| Component | Today | Repo |
|---|---|---|
| `extract.py` / `extract2.ts` | filename glob hardcoded per session | parameterize input dir + ordering rule → **reuse as-is** |
| `check_claims.py` | already generic (argv) | **reuse unchanged** |
| `codegen_dafny.py` Facts emitter + helper lib | generic (`bal`, `sum_rf`, `sumsq_rf`, `max_pp_is`, `rmin_is`, `rmax_is`, `lb_max_is`, `variance`, `count_expr`) | **promote to `dafny_lib.py`** |
| `codegen_dafny.py` claim bodies | **hand-written `bC001…bR024` per session** ← the bottleneck | replaced by generators (§2) |
| Claim text + predicates | hand-written by 2 opus agents per session | auto-generated for ~85%, agents add flavor |
| `mutation_test.sh` / `gen_consistency.sh` / `build_proof_map.py` | near-generic | parameterize paths → **reuse** |
| report HTML | prose+layout hand-built per session | split: auto layer (scoreboard, match cards, charts, appendix) + prose layer |

## 2. Core work: claim generators (the thing that makes it repeatable)

One generator = one claim family = works on every future session. Each emits all three artifacts so nothing is hand-written downstream:

```python
class Generator:
    def find(facts) -> list[Params]      # locate the instances in THIS session (argmax, streak scan, …)
    def canto(p)   -> str                # 口語廣東話 sentence, with 約 + floor convention applied
    def check(p)   -> str                # python_check expression (integer-only)
    def dafny(p)   -> str                # lemma body via dafny_lib helpers
```

Families harvested from the 52 existing claims (each already proven twice):

**Structural / score** — series result; round-win totals; per-match final scores; sweeps (5-0) and who owns them; deciders (full-length matches); match-win order.
**Superlatives** — session-max single-round APM / VS / spike / combo / B2B / T-spins; longest & shortest round; highest match-level APM; per-player maxima. (`max_pp_is` / `rmin_is` / `lb_max_is` already exist.)
**Streaks** — longest consecutive round-win run, with the cross-match-boundary disclosure baked into the wording (session-2 review finding, now permanent).
**Pressure / comeback** — rounds won while facing more queued attack; queued-vs-materialized cancellation totals (semantics enforced in wording, not left to a writer).
**Player aggregates** — totals & per-piece rates for attack, quads, T-spin subtypes, all-clears, holds, finesse faults/perfects, inputs; kills.
**Consistency** — integer variance identity `n·Σx² − (Σx)²` comparisons (already integer-only).
**Situational** — fast-round (<40s) records, high-APM-round records, bounce-back-after-loss rates, sweep-match collapse stats.

Guardrails encoded once, so past bugs cannot recur:
- floor convention for 「約N秒」 (session-2 minor m5)
- streak wording must disclose match boundaries (session-2 minor m2)
- queued vs materialized garbage phrasing (session-1 recurring)
- no simplified glyphs in generated text (assert on output)
- kills ≡ round wins in 1v1 — never presented as independent corroboration (session-2 minor m3)

**Validation gate for this refactor:** regenerate both existing sessions with the generators and diff against the committed hand-made ledgers. Target ≥85% of the 52 claims reproduced with an equivalent predicate; the remainder stay as per-session bespoke entries. This is the phase's acceptance test — no hand-waving.

## 3. The one command

```fish
bin/new-session sessions/2026-08-01 ~/Downloads/replay-batch/
```
Runs, failing loudly at the first bad gate:
1. copy/normalize replays → `sessions/<id>/replays/`
2. both extractors → `facts.json` + `facts2.json`, **diff gate**
3. `build_claims.py` → `claims.json` (auto families) + `check_claims.py` **100% gate**
4. `codegen_dafny.py` → `dafny/*.dfy`; `dafny verify` **0-errors gate**; `mutation_test.sh` **all-killed gate**; `gen_consistency.sh` **byte-identity gate**
5. `build_proof_map.py` → statuses from real verifier output only
6. `build_report.py` → `report.html` with charts, scoreboard, match cards, 52-row appendix — prose sections marked `TODO`
7. print a summary table + the paths

Then the optional prose pass (Claude Code, the phase that genuinely needs judgment): narrative beats + coaching recommendations written against the auto claims, re-run `build_report.py`. The adversarial audit prompt ships in the repo as `docs/AUDIT-PROMPT.md` so the review loop is reproducible too.

## 4. CI + Pages

- `.github/workflows/verify.yml`: on push/PR — install Dafny, then re-run for every session: extractor diff → `check_claims` → `dafny verify` → mutation test → consistency. **The repo's central claim is "these numbers are proven"; CI is what keeps that true.** Actions SHA-pinned.
- GitHub Pages from `docs/`: index listing sessions (date, players, result) → each report + the analyzer tool. Reports are already self-contained, so publishing is a copy.
- Badge in README: verification workflow status.

## 5. Migration of existing work

Both sessions land intact, then get re-verified through the new pipeline (their committed reports stay as-is; only the tooling path changes). Excluded from git: `.playwright-cli/`, `__pycache__/`, `.playwright/`, `proof/shots/`, `*.zip` (~11 MB of QA screenshots). Payload ≈ **17 MB / 83 files** — comfortable.

Session-2's `proof/` (the lighter 20-claim report and its Dafny layer) moves under `sessions/2026-07-24/` as a second artifact rather than being deleted.

## 6. Phasing

| Phase | Output | Ships when |
|---|---|---|
| P1 | Repo created, both sessions + reports + existing scripts committed, README, .gitignore/.gitattributes, Pages live | immediately usable as an archive |
| P2 | CI green: every gate re-runs on push for both sessions | proves the archive's claims stay honest |
| P3 | `pipeline/` extracted & parameterized; both sessions reproducible from it | tool separated from data |
| P4 | Claim generators + `build_claims.py`; ≥85% reproduction gate against existing ledgers | **new sessions become one command** |
| P5 | `build_report.py` templating; prose-only agent pass | full loop |

P1+P2 are mechanical. P4 is the real engineering.

## 7. Open risks

- **Third-party data**: public repo publishes pinglamb's replays, TETR.IO user ID, and a critique of their weaknesses. Worth a heads-up to them; README should credit both players. An `--anonymize` flag in the pipeline is cheap insurance if they'd rather not be named.
- **Generator coverage**: if a future session's drama doesn't fit a family, the pipeline still produces a valid report — bespoke claims are additive, never required.
- **Dafny in CI**: pin the Dafny version (4.11.0 locally); verify time is ~3-5s per session, so CI stays fast.
- **`.ttrm` churn**: single-line JSON; marked `-diff` so PRs stay readable.
